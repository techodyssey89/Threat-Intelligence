## üß† 3. **Pro Tips for Analysts**

- **Automate enrichment**: Use tools like MISP or ThreatConnect to correlate IoCs with MITRE ATT&CK TTPs.
- **Create a weekly digest**: Summarize top threats, CVEs, and actor activity for your team or execs.
- **Use AI Assistants**: Tools like ESET AI Advisor or Copilot (me!) can help you interpret reports and generate summaries.
- **Simulate threats**: Use Red Team reports to build tabletop exercises or purple team scenarios.
